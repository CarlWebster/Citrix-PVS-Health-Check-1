#		Thanks to Martin Therkelsen for finding this logic flaw (bug)
#	From Function OutputAppendixF2, remove the array sort. The same array is sorted in Function OutputAppendixF
#	In Function OutputNicItem, Changed how $powerMgmt is retrieved.

#			TNPVSFarm_Assessment_AppendixC_ConfigWizardItems.csv

#Version 1.10 8-Sep-2016
#	Added Appendix K for 33 Misc Registry Keys
#		Miscellaneous Registry Items That May or May Not Exist on Servers
#		These items may or may not be needed

#	PoSH V2 did not like the “4>$Null”. I test for V2 now and use “2>$Null”.
#	Script now works properly with PoSH V2 and PVS 5.x.x.
#	Since PoSH V2 does not work with the way I forced Verbose on, I changed all the Write-Verbose statements to Write-Host. 
#		You should not be able to tell any difference.

#	Added for Appendix E a link to the Citrix article on DisableTaskOffload
#	Added link to PVS server sizing for server RAM calculation
#	Added comparing Streaming IP addresses to the IP addresses configured for the server
#		If a streaming IP address does not exist on the server, it is an invalid streaming IP address
#		This is a bug in PVS that allows invalid IP addresses to be added for streaming IPs

#Version 1.01 8-Feb-2016
